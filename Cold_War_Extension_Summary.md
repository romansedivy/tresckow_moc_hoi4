## Key Features

### Balanced Progression
- Technologies span 40 years (1950-1990)
- Gradual stat improvements reflecting historical development
- Increased costs for advanced equipment
- Proper prerequisite chains

### Historical Accuracy
- Technologies appear at historically appropriate dates
- Equipment reflects real-world Cold War developments
- Unit types match historical military doctrine

### Gameplay Balance
- Higher-tier equipment requires more resources
- Special forces have terrain bonuses but are expensive
- MBTs are powerful but costly and fuel-hungry
- Support equipment provides tactical advantages

### AI Compatibility
- All technologies have AI weighting
- AI prioritizes based on nation type (major vs minor)
- Date-based AI modifiers encourage historical progression

## Installation Instructions

1. Place all files in their respective mod directories
2. Ensure the mod's `descriptor.mod` is properly configured
3. The technologies will appear in the research trees after 1945
4. Equipment will be available for production once researched
5. New unit types will appear in the division designer

## Compatibility Notes

- Extends existing technology trees rather than replacing them
- Uses standard HOI4 equipment and unit systems
- Should be compatible with most other mods
- May require balancing adjustments for multiplayer

## Future Expansion Possibilities

- Naval technologies (submarines, missiles, carriers)
- Air force technologies (jets, helicopters, missiles)
- Nuclear weapons progression
- Electronic warfare systems
- Space race technologies
- Economic and industrial developments
